Rules:
If category is less than 1% AND there exist other categories in both the Test and Training:
	If other categories are less that 5%, join them into a single category,
	If the rest categories are 5% or more, delete the offending row category from the training set
If category is less than 1% and there is only one other category:
	Delete column from both datasets.
*** Exceptions might be undertaken depending on specific column

Condition1 & Condition2: 
	Given the stucture of this column and that Condition 2 was kind of rebundant and filled wrong (should have empty values when it repeats with column ) I simply joined both colmens, when the value in each row repated itself (norm, norm) it was changed to 1_Condition, when it did not (norm, Feedr), it became 2_Conditons
		
	


HouseStyle: Style of dwelling

	BrkCmn / BrkFace merged into BrkAll
